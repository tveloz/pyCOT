# Script 1: Exploring a Reaction Network with pyCOT

# ======================================== source .venv/bin/activate
# 1. LIBRARY LOADING AND CONFIGURATION: 
# ======================================== Depurador de Python: Archivo actual (pyCOT)
# Import necessary libraries
import os
import sys 
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))) # Add the root directory to the PYTHONPATH

# Import the necessary modules from pyCOT  
from pyCOT.io.functions import read_txt, print_reaction_network
from pyCOT.rn_visualize import rn_visualize_html, rn_get_visualization

# 2. CREATING THE REACTION_NETWORK OBJECT
# ======================================== 
# file_path = 'Txt/Farm.txt' 
file_path = 'Txt/autopoietic.txt'  # Change this path according to the desired file
rn = read_txt(file_path)  # Creates the variable rn containing an object of ReactionNetwork class

""" 
Some of the methods of the ReactionNetwork class are: 
- rn.species(): Returns a list of Species objects present in the network.
- rn.reactions(): Returns a list of Reaction objects defined in the network.
- rn.stoichiometry_matrix(): Returns an object of class `StoichiometryMatrix`, which represents a matrix 
    where each entry corresponds to the net stoichiometric coefficient of a species in a specific reaction.
"""

# ========================================
# 3. SPECIES OF THE REACTION NETWORK
# ========================================
# Print the list of Species objects
"""
The Species object has the following attributes:
- index: The index of the species in the reaction network.
- name: The name of the species (e.g., 'l', 's1', 's2').
- quantity: The initial quantity or concentration of the species in the reaction network (can be None if not set).

# ========================================
# 4. REACTIONS OF THE REACTION NETWORK
# ========================================
# Print the list of Reactions objects
"""
rn.reactions() returns a list of Reaction objects, each representing a reaction in the reaction network.
The Reaction class has the following attributes:    
- node: The node of the reaction in the reaction network.
    - index: The index of the reaction node in the graph.
    - name: The name of the reaction (e.g., 'R1', 'R2').
    - rate: The kinetic rate law associated with the reaction (can be None if not yet defined).
- edges: A list of Edge objects representing the edges of the reaction.
    - index: The index of the edge in the reaction graph.
    - source_index: The index of the source node (species or reaction) from which the edge originates.
    - target_index: The index of the target node (species or reaction) to which the edge points.
    - species_name: The name of the chemical species involved in the reaction.
    - type: The role of the species in the reaction, either 'reactant' or 'product'.
    - coefficient: The stoichiometric coefficient of the species in the reaction.
